Partnerships & Product leader turned Software Engineer with a passion for designing and building delightful user experiences. I’ve spent the last 10+ years at Apple, Stripe, and Uber leading cross functional teams composed of Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Legal, Operations, and Finance to launch and scale new products. Working with so many stakeholders over the course of my career has provided me with a comprehensive perspective and the ability to seamlessly identify and execute initiatives to achieve business goals.

My enthusiasm for teamwork and a competitive spirit extends beyond the professional realm. I’ve played in chess tournaments, am a local trampoline dodgeball champion and host regular poker and board game nights.

I’m always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. If you have any recommendations for books, podcasts, or DIY projects, let me know!
